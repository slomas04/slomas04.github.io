      <li>For my undergraduate dissertation, I developed the "Sociogram Analysis Toolkit"; 
        A web app built on Laravel + Livewire that is able to display quick and easy visualisations
         of scraped Instagram user data. Aimed at tracking the behaviour and connections of online radicalisers, 
         it utilises a variety of different SNA methods.<img class="border-b-2 border-[#444444] pb-2 mb-2" src="Media/graphgif.gif">
